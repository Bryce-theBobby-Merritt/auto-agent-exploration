    "Claude: Great question! Let's apply Anthropic's framework to **venture capital sourcing** (finding and evaluating potential investment opportunities):\n",
    "\n",
    "## VC Sourcing Through the Agent Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **High Complexity** ✓\n",
    "- **Multi-step process**: Scan thousands of companies → filter by criteria → research founders → analyze market → assess competitive landscape → synthesize investment thesis\n",
    "- **Diverse data sources**: Crunchbase, LinkedIn, patent databases, news articles, academic papers, GitHub repos, hiring signals, G2/review sites\n",
    "- **Contextual judgment**: Understanding subtle signals (team quality, market timing, product-market fit indicators) requires connecting disparate information\n",
    "- **Similar to coding**: Just as going from design doc → PR requires orchestrating many steps, going from investment criteria → qualified deal flow requires multi-stage research and synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **High Value** ✓✓✓\n",
    "- **Enormous upside**: Finding one unicorn can return an entire fund (100-1000x returns)\n",
    "- **Time arbitrage**: Partners spend 30-50% of time on sourcing; even 20% efficiency gain = massive leverage\n",
    "- **Competitive advantage**: Better sourcing = seeing deals earlier = better terms and selection\n",
    "- **Network effects**: Quality sourcing builds reputation → more inbound → better deals\n",
    "- **Dollar impact**: Potentially $10M+ in value per hour saved for successful VCs\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Medium to High Viability** ⚠️ (This is the key question)\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- LLMs excel at information synthesis, pattern recognition across unstructured data\n",
    "- Can process far more companies than human analysts (scale advantage)\n",
    "- Good at initial filtering, competitive analysis, market sizing research\n",
    "- Strong at writing investment memos once thesis is clear\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- **Relationship-dependent**: Best deals come through warm intros and network trust (hard to automate)\n",
    "- **Tacit knowledge**: Recognizing \"founder quality\" or \"market timing\" involves gut feel developed over years\n",
    "- **Signal vs. noise**: Many pattern-matching heuristics (\"X for Y\" pitches) don't predict success\n",
    "- **Data recency**: Hottest startups may not be in public databases yet\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verdict**: Medium-High viability for **research and analysis** phases, Medium viability for **relationship/judgment** phases\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Low Cost of Error / Low Cost to Prevent Error** ⚠️⚠️ (Critical concern)\n",
    "**This is where VC sourcing differs most from coding:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**High cost of errors:**\n",
    "- **False negatives** (missing a great company): Could cost $100M+ in returns\n",
    "- **False positives** (pursuing bad deals): Wastes partner time, opportunity cost on better deals\n",
    "- **No \"unit tests\"**: Can't verify if you passed on the next Stripe until years later\n",
    "- **Irreversible**: Unlike code bugs, you can't patch a missed investment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error prevention is expensive:**\n",
    "- Would still need experienced partners to review agent output\n",
    "- Hard to validate agent's judgment without doing the work yourself\n",
    "- Relationship damage if agent-generated outreach is low-quality\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, some mitigation:**\n",
    "- Agent could focus on **top-of-funnel** (casting wider net) where error cost is lower\n",
    "- Use agent for research/memo writing, keep humans for judgment/relationships\n",
    "- A/B test by comparing agent-sourced deals to traditional methods over time\n",

    "## Overall Assessment for VC Sourcing Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best fit**: ✓✓✓ for **research and analysis workflows**\n",
    "- Market mapping and landscape analysis\n",
    "- Competitive intelligence gathering\n",
    "- Investment memo drafting\n",
    "- Portfolio company monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "**Medium fit**: ✓✓ for **initial deal screening**\n",
    "- Scanning larger universe of companies\n",
    "- Flagging interesting signals (hiring spikes, product launches, founder backgrounds)\n",
    "- Enriching inbound deal flow with context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Poor fit**: ✗ for **relationship building and final judgment**\n",
    "- Warm introductions and network cultivation\n",
    "- Final investment decisions\n",
    "- Founder assessment and due diligence\n",
    "\n",
    "**The unlock**: Treating it like an **analyst+ tool** rather than a replacement for partner judgment. The value comes from expanding the aperture (seeing 10x more companies) and improving research quality, not from autonomous decision-making."

    "- Bad framing → wasted effort on wrong questions\n",
    "- Investment thesis requires strategic context agents lack\n",

    "- \"We're looking for vertical SaaS in healthcare, specifically around provider burnout\"\n",
    "- Portfolio gaps: \"We need more enterprise deals to balance consumer bets\"\n",

    "- Prevents wasting time on deep dives into wrong companies\n",

    "**Breakpoint: Agent produces market map with players positioned**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why intervene here:**\n",
    "- Market maps require strategic interpretation, not just data plotting\n",
    "- Humans see \"white space\" that matters vs. white space that's a graveyard\n",
    "- Nuance on \"looks crowded but incumbents are vulnerable\"\n",

    "- Conviction comes from connecting dots agents might not see\n",
    "\n",

    "- Risk callouts: \"Address the regulatory risk explicitly—it's what partners will ask\"\n",

    "2. **Judgment calls** - Prioritizing conflicting signals\n",
    "3. **Creative synthesis** - Building investment thesis\n",
    "4. **Relationship context** - Network effects, reputation considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Quality Control Breakpoints (MEDIUM):**\n",
    "1. **Pattern matching** - \"I've seen this before\" experience\n",
    "2. **Sanity checks** - Catching agent hallucinations or logic errors\n",
    "3. **Nuance** - Reading between the lines\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Efficiency Breakpoints (LOW but useful):**\n",
    "1. **Course corrections** - Redirecting research mid-stream\n",
    "2. **Refinement** - Polishing outputs for specific audience\n",
